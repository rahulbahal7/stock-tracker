stock-tracker
=============
Basically, what I did was that I supplied the Yahoo servers with the ticker information of the stock(s) of which I needed information about. 
Along with this information I also sent what I call “symbols” that target the specific details of the those stocks that I need 
(which is what is intended as we don’t want to be overwhelmed with data). The servers picked up on the tickers, recognized the stock, 
and understood the symbols and the information that was required to be replied back to me along with that stock. 

The Stock Tracker can be used as an application software on a personal computer by and individual also it can be included as a 
web application on a website.
It is complete with a signup feature that requires the user to signup by providing his/her basic details
It is equipped with security features that require the login details, namely, username and password.
